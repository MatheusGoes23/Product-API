<h2>Developing a API REST product management system with Spring Boot</h2>

In this project, a small system for managing product in a company through a API REST, created with Spring Boot, will be developed.

During the project, the following topics will be developed and addressed:

* Initial project setup with Spring Boot Initialzr
* Creation of data model for mapping entities in databases
* Development of user management operations (Registration, reading, updating and removal of people from a system).
* Relation of each of the above operations with the REST architectural pattern, and the explanation of each of the REST concepts involved during project development.
* Cloud system deployment through Heroku

To run the project on the terminal, type the following command:

```shell script
mvn spring-boot:run 
```

After executing the above command, just open the following address and view the project execution:

```
http://localhost:8080/api/products
```


To open the documentation (available through Swagger 2) of all operations implemented with the REST architectural pattern, access the following link below:

```
